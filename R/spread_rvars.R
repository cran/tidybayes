#' Extract draws from a Bayesian model into tidy data frames of random variables
#'
#' Extract draws from a Bayesian model for one or more variables (possibly with named
#' dimensions) into one of two types of long-format data frames of [posterior::rvar] objects.
#'
#' Imagine a JAGS or Stan fit named `model`. The model may contain a variable named
#' `b[i,v]` (in the JAGS or Stan language) with dimension `i` in `1:100` and
#' dimension `v` in `1:3`. However, the default format for draws returned from
#' JAGS or Stan in R will not reflect this indexing structure, instead
#' they will have multiple columns with names like `"b[1,1]"`, `"b[2,1]"`, etc.
#'
#' `spread_rvars` and `gather_rvars` provide a straightforward
#' syntax to translate these columns back into properly-indexed [`rvar`]s in two different
#' tidy data frame formats, optionally recovering dimension types (e.g. factor levels) as it does so.
#'
#' `spread_rvars` will spread names of variables in the model across the data frame as column names,
#' whereas `gather_rvars` will gather variable names into a single column named `".variable"` and place
#' values of variables into a column named `".value"`. To use naming schemes from other packages
#' (such as `broom`), consider passing
#' results through functions like [to_broom_names()] or [to_ggmcmc_names()].
#'
#' For example, `spread_rvars(model, a[i], b[i,v])` might return a data frame with:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item column `"i"`: value in `1:5`
#'    \item column `"v"`: value in `1:10`
#'    \item column `"a"`: [rvar] containing draws from `"a[i]"`
#'    \item column `"b"`: [rvar] containing draws from `"b[i,v]"`
#'  }
#'
#' `gather_rvars(model, a[i], b[i,v])` on the same model would return a data frame with:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item column `"i"`: value in `1:5`
#'    \item column `"v"`: value in `1:10`, or `NA`
#'      on rows where `".variable"` is `"a"`.
#'    \item column `".variable"`: value in `c("a", "b")`.
#'    \item column `".value"`: [rvar] containing draws from `"a[i]"` (when `".variable"` is `"a"`)
#'      or `"b[i,v]"` (when `".variable"` is `"b"`)
#'  }
#'
#' `spread_rvars` and `gather_rvars` can use type information
#' applied to the `model` object by [recover_types()] to convert columns
#' back into their original types. This is particularly helpful if some of the dimensions in
#' your model were originally factors. For example, if the `v` dimension
#' in the original data frame `data` was a factor with levels `c("a","b","c")`,
#' then we could use `recover_types` before `spread_rvars`:
#'
#' \preformatted{model \%>\%
#'  recover_types(data) %\>\%
#'  spread_rvars(model, b[i,v])
#' }
#'
#' Which would return the same data frame as above, except the `"v"` column
#' would be a value in `c("a","b","c")` instead of `1:3`.
#'
#' For variables that do not share the same subscripts (or share
#' some but not all subscripts), we can supply their specifications separately.
#' For example, if we have a variable `d[i]` with the same `i` subscript
#' as `b[i,v]`, and a variable `x` with no subscripts, we could do this:
#'
#' \preformatted{spread_rvars(model, x, d[i], b[i,v])}
#'
#' Which is roughly equivalent to this:
#'
#' \preformatted{spread_rvars(model, x) \%>\%
#'  inner_join(spread_rvars(model, d[i])) \%>\%
#'  inner_join(spread_rvars(model, b[i,v]))
#' }
#'
#' Similarly, this:
#'
#' \preformatted{gather_rvars(model, x, d[i], b[i,v])}
#'
#' Is roughly equivalent to this:
#'
#' \preformatted{bind_rows(
#'  gather_rvars(model, x),
#'  gather_rvars(model, d[i]),
#'  gather_rvars(model, b[i,v])
#' )}
#'
#' The `c` and `cbind` functions can be used to combine multiple variable names that have
#' the same dimensions. For example, if we have several variables with the same
#' subscripts `i` and `v`, we could do either of these:
#'
#' \preformatted{spread_rvars(model, c(w, x, y, z)[i,v])}
#' \preformatted{spread_rvars(model, cbind(w, x, y, z)[i,v])  # equivalent}
#'
#' Each of which is roughly equivalent to this:
#'
#' \preformatted{spread_rvars(model, w[i,v], x[i,v], y[i,v], z[i,v])}
#'
#' Besides being more compact, the `c()`-style syntax is currently also slightly
#' faster (though that may change).
#'
#' Dimensions can be left nested in the resulting [rvar] objects by leaving their names
#' blank; e.g. `spread_rvars(model, b[i,])` will place the first index (`i`) into
#' rows of the data frame but leave the second index nested in the `b` column
#' (see *Examples* below).
