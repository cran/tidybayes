#' Turn tidy data frames of variables from a Bayesian model back into untidy data
#'
#' Inverse operations of [spread_draws()] and [gather_draws()], giving
#' results that look like [tidy_draws()].
#'
#' These functions take symbolic specifications of variable names and dimensions in the same format as
#' [spread_draws()] and [gather_draws()] and invert the tidy data frame back into
#' a data frame whose column names are variables with dimensions in them.
#'
#' @param data A tidy data frame of draws, such as one output by `spread_draws` or `gather_draws`.
#' @param ... Expressions in the form of
#' `variable_name[dimension_1, dimension_2, ...]`. See [spread_draws()].
#' @param draw_indices Character vector of column names in `data` that
#' should be treated as indices of draws. The default is `c(".chain",".iteration",".draw")`,
#' which are the same names used for chain, iteration, and draw indices returned by
#' [spread_draws()] or [gather_draws()].
#' @param drop_indices Drop the columns specified by `draw_indices` from the resulting data frame. Default `FALSE`.
#' @param variable The name of the column in `data` that contains the names of variables from the model.
#' @param value The name of the column in `data` that contains draws from the variables.
#' @return A data frame.
