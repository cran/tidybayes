\title{Thinned subset of posterior sample from a Bayesian analysis of perception of correlation.}
\description{
Data from Kay and Heer (2016), primarily used for testing and examples.
}
\details{
For more details, see Kay and Heer (2016) or the Github repository describing the analysis:
\url{https://github.com/mjskay/ranking-correlation}. The original experiment (but not this analysis of it)
is described in Harrison \emph{et al.} (2014).

This version of the posterior sample is thinned substantially and has omitted several
parameters in order for it to be a more manageable size.
